<b>Target: Voice Assistant to open apps using machine learning</b>
<br><br>
Step 1: Capture voice clip.<br>
Step 2: Link voice clip to application path, by speech to text or direct machine learning.<br>
Step 3: Design GUI app which remains active in background and starts capturing voice when it hears a certain keyword.<br>
Step 4: Open the requested app.<br><br>

Main problem to avoid: Do not ask user again and again for some action.
